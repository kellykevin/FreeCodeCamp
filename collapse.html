* Introduction to servers chris..


A server is a computer that serves information to other computers. These computers, called clients, can connect to a server through either a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), such as the Internet. ... A file server is a computer that stores files that can be accessed by other computers

Hardwarewise a server is just a computer without somebody working behind it at a monitor. Examples in a typical business networked environment are a mail server which does all the mail traffic and storage, a print server that handles all printers or a database server which houses the corporate database. 

Softwarewise a server is program that does some typical server tasks like outlined above. With a (multitasking) operating system like Unix or Windows 2003 Server there is no objection to run a print server program and a mail server program on the same machine, if it can handle the workload.

                        * What SEVERS do olivier...<br>

servers are typically used to provide common file storage and access to multiple computers on a network, to control access to computers on a network via passwords, etc.

 In my case, A server is used to restrict access to 10 networked computers, via logon name and password, so that only those authorized can use the workstations. At any time, we typically have 150 to 200 people so authorized. The main server also is a file server that permits each authorized user to have their individual storage space, which they can accesss from any workstation on the local network.

                        	* what types of servers exists and are used kevin...<br>

Servers are often dedicated, meaning that they perform no other tasks besides their server tasks.
  This list categorizes the many different types of servers used in the marketplace today.
Server Types
Proxy Server
A proxy server sits between a client program (typically a Web browser) and an external server (typically another server on the Web) to filter requests, improve performance, and share connections.
Mail Server
Almost as ubiquitous and crucial as Web servers, mail servers move and store mail over corporate networks (viaLANs and WANs) and across the Internet.
Web Server
At its core, a Web server serves static content to a Web browser by loading a file from a disk and serving it across the network to a user's Web browser. This entire exchange is mediated by the browser and server talking to each other using HTTP.
FTP Server
One of the oldest of the Internet services, File Transfer Protocol makes it possible to move one or more files securely between computers while providing file security and organization as well as transfer control.
